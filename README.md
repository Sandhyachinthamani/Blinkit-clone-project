🚀 **Overview**  
This is one of my **first few projects** after starting to learn HTML, CSS, and web layout techniques.  
It’s a **practice webpage clone** of the Blinkit homepage (Grofers) — built to explore **flexbox, image layouts, and overflow handling** in CSS.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- 🧩 Using **Flexbox** for horizontal layouts  
- 🎨 Managing **image grids and responsive sections**  
- ⚙️ Fixing **horizontal overflow (x-scroll)** using `overflow-x: hidden` and layout corrections  
- 💡 Structuring a webpage with **header, sections, and footer**
